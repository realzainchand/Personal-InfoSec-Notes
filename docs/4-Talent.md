# Talent vs Practice: What Actually Matters

## Isn't talent just being fast to learn?

Some people just get things faster. Maybe it's how their brain works, or maybe they've seen something similar before, or they're just used to learning stuff. 

But fast doesn't mean better. It just means they need fewer tries at first.

But in the long run? **Consistency beats speed.**

It's like racing someone who sprints fast for 10 seconds then gives up, while you just jog slowly and never stop.

## Practice is what builds the skill, not talent

At first, things feel confusing. You don't get them. You feel stupid. 

But that's not stupidity. That's just being new.

Like when I first opened a book on networks, I had no clue what packets or protocols meant. 

I thought it was all just random tech jargon. 

But then I watched one video, then another. I drew a few diagrams. 

I wrote dumb notes in my own words. Slowly, things started to click.

Not because I'm talented. Just because I stuck with it longer than I wanted to.

## Even if you're smart, you'll still fail without reps

You can't just "know" how to box. 

You might understand the moves. You might be good at strategy. 

But unless you've been **hit** a few times, unless you've **missed punches**, unless you've **trained your body**, 

You'll fall apart in a real fight.

Theory never beats muscle memory.

## CR7 trained when no one was watching

People say Cristiano is gifted. 

Maybe he is. But that's not what made him the best.

He used to practice **after** practice. 

He stayed back to do more drills. 

Others left. He stayed. 

He watched his diet, tracked his sleep, trained every day like it was a final match.

That's not talent. 

That's obsession. 

And it worked.

## 11-year-old kids who code

There are kids who start young, like that 11-year-old who builds games or runs a YouTube channel. 

They're not special. They just started earlier with curiosity, and they kept going.

They didn't get there overnight. 

It's just that we didn't **see** their early boring phase.

## My Linux journey

I used to be scared of the black screen (terminal). 

Now I enjoy using it. 

I didn't read a book and suddenly become good. 

I just **typed commands**, broke the system, fixed it, Googled stuff, broke it again, and repeated.

Every mistake taught me more than a YouTube video ever could.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## People think talent means no struggle. That's wrong

Just because someone's ahead of you doesn't mean they're smarter. 

They might've just started earlier. 

Or they went through 3 or 4 months of struggle already, and now you're seeing the results.

No one posts their **frustrated midnight moments** on social media. 

But those are the real part of learning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What really matters

- Keep showing up 
- Don't judge progress in days. Look at months 
- Stop comparing yourself to others 
- Focus on what you didn't know yesterday that you know today 
- It's okay if you don't get it the first time, or the fifth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning is like lifting weights

You don't get strong on day one. 

You lift small, regularly. 

You get sore. 

You recover. 

And one day, you realize you can lift what you couldn't even imagine touching two months ago.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thing

When you say, "I'm not talented," 

what you really mean is, 

"I haven't put enough time into this yet."

And that's fine. 

You don't need to be a genius. 

You just need to **not quit** when it's boring, hard, or slow.

That's the real hack.
